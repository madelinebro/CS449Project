Sprint #0 Report

Objectives
Make decisions on the SOS software development project.

Learn unit testing and GUI programming in the language of your choice.

Key Decisions

Object-oriented programming language: Python

GUI library: Pygame

IDE: Jupyter Lab

xUnit framework: unittest

Programming style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Project hosting site: Github.com

Unit Testing 

Since I will be using Python to develop this game, I felt as if the best choice for me was to perform unit
testing using the unittest library in Python. This tutorial from the Cognitive Programmer was a
great introduction to the framework. I decided to begin with a simple test to check for proper addition, using
a user-defined function instead of the built in sum function that Python comes with.

GUI Programming

I have experience using Pygame, so that is the GUI library I chose.
